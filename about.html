    <div id="about">
      <p>
        As an avid adventurer, I am drawn to beautiful, wild, desolate, and
        rugged places. They allure me with their untamable and mysterious
        grandeur. Of all these magnificent places, the Rocky Mountains are what
        I treasure most. The quote by John Muir, "The mountains are calling and
        I must go," was something I truly experienced. After living in Montana
        right after I graduated college, then shortly moving to Colorado, I fell
        in love with the mountains. After a few short years I moved back to my
        home state of Arkansas. While a beautiful state in its own right, it did
        not inspire me like the states out west. This is when I heard the
        mountains calling. So I went. I now call Colorado home.
      </p>

        Living in Colorado allows me to spend most of my free time wandering
        through the mountains where I enjoy hiking, fishing, snowboarding,
        exploring, and occasionally snapping a few photos. Every trip to the
        mountains draws me in deeper, leaving me with a desire to experience
        more.
      </p>

        Although I enjoy several activites, hiking is definitely the ultimate
        experience. It is the best way to see and explore the state. Legs can
        take you infinitely more places than a vehicle. I love the challenge of
        hiking the state's 14ers. My goal is to summit all 58 in the state.
        Hiking these giants gives me some of the best views. I can see for miles
        in every direction. Each new 14er gives me new, beautiful perspective of
        just how magnificent the Rocky Mountains truly are.
